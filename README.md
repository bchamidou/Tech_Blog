# Tech_Blog
The Tech Blog is a blog website where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This application follows the MVC paradigm and it is using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
